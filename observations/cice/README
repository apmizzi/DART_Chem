This directory contains data files from yongfei that contain
sea ice percentage observations from the snow and ice data center,
along with an ncl converter from binary to netcdf, and netcdf
to obs_seq.

the 'cice_to_obs' source code right now is still the text converter.
this is a NON_WORKING baseline.  i am updating this
right now.  unless i run into problems, my plan is to try to
read the binary files directly and convert to obs_seq in a
single step, rather than go through netcdf intermediates.
