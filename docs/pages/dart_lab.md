# DART_LAB Tutorial

[Presentations](#Presentations) / [Matlab Programs](#Matlab) / [TERMS OF
USE](#Legalese)

## Overview

The files in this directory contain PDF tutorial materials on DART, and
Matlab exercises. See below for links to the PDF files and a list of the
corresponding matlab scripts.

This tutorial begins at a more introductory level than the materials in
the tutorial directory, and includes hands-on exercises at several
points. In a workshop setting, these materials and exercises took about
1.5 days to complete.

## Matlab Hands-On Exercises

In the *matlab* subdirectory are a set of Matlab scripts and GUI
(graphical user interface) programs which are exercises that go with the
tutorial. Each is interactive with settings that can be changed and
rerun to explore various options. A valid
[Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) license is needed to
run these scripts.

The exercises use the following functions:

  - gaussian_product
  - oned_model
  - oned_ensemble
  - run_lorenz_63
  - run_lorenz_96
  - twod_ensemble

To run these, cd into the DART_LAB/matlab directory, start matlab, and
type the names at the prompt.
