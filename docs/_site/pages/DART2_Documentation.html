<p>There are two broad classes of models supported by DART. Some are
‘low-order’ models, generally single-threaded, subroutine-callable, and
idealized: there are no <strong>real</strong> observations of these systems. The
other class of models are ‘high-order’ models. There <strong>are</strong> real
observations of these systems. Or at least, we like to think so …</p>

<h3 id="lorenz_63">lorenz_63</h3>

<p>This is the 3-variable model as described in: Lorenz, E. N.
1963. Deterministic nonperiodic flow. <em>J. Atmos.
Sci.</em> <strong>20</strong>, 130-141.<br />
The system of equations is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>X' = -sigma*X + sigma*Y
Y' = -XZ + rX - Y
Z' =  XY -bZ
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span id="lorenz_84"></span></p>

<h3 id="lorenz_84">lorenz_84</h3>

<p>This model is based on:   Lorenz E. N., 1984: Irregularity: A
fundamental property of the atmosphere. <em>Tellus</em>,  <strong>36A</strong>, 98-110.<br />
The system of equations is:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>X' = -Y^2 - Z^2  - aX  + aF
Y' =  XY  - bXZ  - Y   + G
Z' = bXY  +  XZ  - Z
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where a, b, F, and G are the model parameters.</p>

<p><span id="NINEvar"></span></p>

<h3 id="9var">9var</h3>

<p>This model provides interesting off-attractor transients that behave
something like gravity waves.</p>

<p><span id="lorenz_96"></span></p>

<h3 id="lorenz_96">lorenz_96</h3>

<p>This is the model we use to become familiar with new architectures,
i.e., it is the one we use ‘first’. It can be called as a subroutine or
as a separate executable. We can test this model both single-threaded
and mpi-enabled.</p>

<p>Quoting from the <strong>Lorenz 1998</strong> paper:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>… the authors introduce a model consisting of 40 ordinary
differential equations, with the dependent variables representing
values of some atmospheric quantity at 40 sites spaced equally about a
latitude circle. The equations contain quadratic, linear, and constant
terms representing advection, dissipation, and external forcing.
Numerical integration indicates that small errors (differences between
solutions) tend to double in about 2 days. Localized errors tend to
spread eastward as they grow, encircling the globe after about 14
days.<br />
…<br />
We have chosen a model with J variables, denoted by X<sub>1</sub>,
…, X<sub>J</sub>; in most of our experiments we have let J = 40. The
governing equations are:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>dXj/dt = (Xj+1 - Xj-2)Xj-1 - Xj + F         (1)
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>for <em>j</em> = 1, …, J. To make Eq. (1) meaningful for all values of <em>j</em>
we define X<sub>-1</sub> = X<sub>J-1</sub>, X<sub>0</sub> =
X<sub>J</sub>, and X<sub>J+1</sub> = X<sub>1</sub>, so that the
variables form a cyclic chain, and may be looked at as values of some
unspecified scalar meteorological quantity, perhaps vorticity or
temperature, at J equally spaced sites extending around a latitude
circle. Nothing will simulate the atmosphere’s latitudinal or vertical
extent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span id="lorenz_96_2scale"></span></p>

<h3 id="lorenz_96_2scale">lorenz_96_2scale</h3>

<p>This is the Lorenz 96 2-scale model, documented in Lorenz (1995). It
also has the option of the variant on the model from Smith (2001), which
is invoked by setting <em>local_y = .true.</em> in the namelist. The time
step, coupling, forcing, number of X variables, and the number of Ys per
X are all specified in the namelist. Defaults are chosen depending on
whether the Lorenz or Smith option is specified in the namelist. Lorenz
is the default model. Interface written by <strong>Josh Hacker</strong>. Thanks
Josh!</p>

<p><span id="forced_lorenz_96"></span></p>

<h3 id="forced_lorenz_96">forced_lorenz_96</h3>

<p>The forced_lorenz_96 model implements the standard L96 equations
except that the forcing term, F, is added to the state vector and is
assigned an independent value at each gridpoint. The result is a model
that is twice as big as the standard L96 model. The forcing can be
allowed to vary in time or can be held fixed so that the model looks
like the standard L96 but with a state vector that includes the constant
forcing term. An option is also included to add random noise to the
forcing terms as part of the time tendency computation which can help in
assimilation performance. If the random noise option is turned off (see
namelist) the time tendency of the forcing terms is 0.</p>

<p><span id="lorenz_04"></span></p>

<h3 id="lorenz_04">lorenz_04</h3>

<p>The reference for these models is Lorenz, E.N., 2005: Designing chaotic
models. <em>J. Atmos. Sci.</em>, <strong>62</strong>, 1574-1587.<br />
Model II is a single-scale model, similar to Lorenz 96, but with spatial
continuity in the waves. Model III is a two-scale model. It is
fudamentally different from the Lorenz 96 two-scale model because of the
spatial continuity and the fact that both scales are projected onto a
single variable of integration. The scale separation is achived by a
spatial filter and is therefore not perfect (i.e. there is leakage). The
slow scale in model III is model II, and thus model II is a deficient
form of model III. The basic equations are documented in Lorenz (2005)
and also in the model_mod.f90 code. The user is free to choose model II
or III with a Namelist variable.</p>

<p><span id="simple_advection"></span></p>

<h3 id="simple_advection">simple_advection</h3>

<p>This model is on a periodic one-dimensional domain. A wind field is
modeled using Burger’s Equation with an upstream semi-lagrangian
differencing. This diffusive numerical scheme is stable and forcing is
provided by adding in random gaussian noise to each wind grid variable
independently at each timestep. An Eulerian option with
centered-in-space differencing is also provided. The Eulerian
differencing is both numerically unstable and subject to shock
formation. However, it can sometimes be made stable in assimilation mode
(see recent work by Majda and collaborators).</p>

<h3 id="bgrid_solo">bgrid_solo</h3>

<p>This is a dynamical core for B-grid dynamics using the Held-Suarez
forcing. The resolution is configurable, and the entire model can be run
as a subroutine. <em>Status:</em> supported.</p>

<p>There are several <a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/current.html">supported
versions</a> of the Community
Earth System Model (CESM) and its ancestors
(<a href="http://www.cesm.ucar.edu/models/ccsm4.0">CCSM4.0</a>). Contact us for
support for unreleased, developmental versions of CESM. Not all are
supported because each requires modification of some subroutines and
setup scripts in order to work with DART. The supported versions depend
to some degree on the CESM component(s) which will be used as the
assimilating model(s). See CAM-FV, POP, and CICE, below, and <a href="CESM_setup_guidelines.html">CESM setup

general, later versions of CESM can build the latest component models

model for several generations of CESM releases. The Manhattan release of
DART provides interfaces to CESM1.5 and CESM2.0. The setup scripts for
those CESMs will currently build only the finite volume dynamical core
of CAM. This works for all of the variants of CAM-FV; CAM-Chem, WACCM,
WACCM-X. An interface between DART and the spectral element dy-core of
CAM is available in DART Classic, and will be brought into the Manhattan

<p>The code distribution was getting cluttered with datasets, boundary

interesting to all people who downloaded the DART code. This is
compounded by the fact subversion makes a local (hidden) copy of the

It just made sense to make all the large files available on as
‘as-needed’ basis.</p>

<p>To keep the size of the DART distribution down we have a separate
www-site to provide some observation sequences, initial conditions, and
general datasets. It is our intent to populate this site with some
‘verification’ results, i.e. assimilations that were known to be ‘good’
and that should be fairly reproducible - appropriate to test the DART
installation.</p>

<h1 id="creating-initial-conditions-for-dart">Creating initial conditions for DART</h1>

<p>The idea is to generate an ensemble that has sufficient ‘spread’ to
cover the range of possible solutions. Insufficient spread can (and
usually will) lead to poor assimilations. Think ‘filter divergence’.</p>

<p>Generating an ensemble of initial conditions can be done in lots of
ways, only a couple of which will be discussed here. The first is to
generate a single initial condition and let DART perturb it with noise
of a nature you specify to generate as many ensemble members as you
like. The second is to take some existing collection of model states and
convert them to DART initial conditions files and then use the <a href="http://nco.sourceforge.net/">NCO
operators</a> to set the proper date in the
files. The hard part is then coming up with the original collection of
model state(s).</p>

<h3 id="adding-noise-to-a-single-model-state">Adding noise to a single model state</h3>

<p>This method works well for some models, and fails miserably for others.
As it stands, DART supplies a routine that can add gaussian noise to
every element of a state vector. This can cause some models to be
numerically unstable. You can supply your own
<em>model_mod:pert_model_copies()</em> if you want a more sophisticated
perturbation scheme.</p>

<h3 id="using-a-collection-of-model-states">Using a collection of model states.</h3>

<p>Simply collect the filenames of all the model netCDF files - one per
ensemble member - and specify them through the <em>input.nml</em> 
<em>&amp;filter_nml:input_state_file_list = ”restarts_in.txt”</em></p>

<p>Frequently, the initial ensemble of restart files is some climatological
collection. For CAM experiments, we usually start with <em>N</em> different
‘January 1’ states … from <em>N</em> different years. The timestamp in those
files can be ignored through namelist control. Experience has shown that
it takes less than a week of assimilating 4x/day to achieve a steady
ensemble spread. WRF has its own method of generating an initial
ensemble. For that, it is best to go to contact someone familiar with
WRF/DART.</p>

<p><span id="low_order_spinup"></span></p>

<h3 id="initial-conditions-for-the-low-order-models">Initial conditions for the low-order models.</h3>

<p>In general, there are ‘restart files’ for the low-order models that
already exist as ASCII sources for netCDF files. These files are usually
called <em>work/filter_input.cdl</em> and can be converted to netCDF files by
using the <em>ncgen -o</em> unix command.</p>

<p>You can generate your own ensemble by adding noise to a single
<em>perfect_input.nc</em> file and run <em>filter</em>. At present (27 March 2017),
the way to specify the input state file is to use the
<em>input_state_file_list</em> mechanism. Simply put the name of the file
into the file referenced by <em>input_state_file_list</em>. In this example,
<em>filter_input_list.txt</em> would contain exactly one line - the string
“perfect_input.nc”. You will also need an observation sequence file,
and you may want to explicitly state the start/stop times.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&amp;filter_nml
    ...
    input_state_files            = 'null',
    input_state_file_list        = 'filter_input_list.txt'
    perturb_from_single_instance = .true.
    ens_size                     = [whatever you want]
    init_time_days               = 0
    init_time_seconds            = 0
    first_obs_days               = 0
    first_obs_seconds            = 0
    last_obs_days                = 0
    last_obs_seconds             = 0
    output_state_files           = 'null',
    output_state_file_list       = 'filter_output_list.txt'
    ...

<p>In this example, the ensemble will be created with whatever file name
you put in <em>filter_output_list.txt</em>.</p>

<h1 id="perfect-model-or-osse-experiments">‘Perfect Model’ or ‘OSSE’ experiments.</h1>

<p>Once a model is compatible with the DART facility all of the
functionality of DART is available. This includes ‘perfect model’
experiments (also called Observing System Simulation Experiments -
OSSEs). Essentially, the model is run forward from a known state and, at
predefined times, an observation forward operator is applied to the
model state to harvest synthetic observations. This model trajectory is
known as the ‘true state’. The synthetic observations are then used in
an assimilation experiment. The assimilation performance can then be
evaluated precisely because the true state (of the model) is known.
Since the same forward operator is used to harvest the synthetic
observations as well as during the assimilation, the
‘representativeness’ error of the assimilation system is not an issue.</p>

<p>The example described in this section uses low-order models, but the
logic and procedure is <strong>exactly</strong> the same for high-order models; the
complication is usually that researchers want more sophisticated
observation networks than those described here. All you have to do is
use the DART tools to create an observation sequence file (even a REAL
observation sequence file), and use that instead of creating one by hand
with <em>create_obs_sequence</em> and <em>create_fixed_network_sequence</em>.
<em>perfect_model_obs</em> will simply ignore the actual observation values
in this case and only use the observation metadata. Take care that the
observation error values in the file are appropriate for an OSSE - the
converters usually assume some sort of representativeness error in the
observation error specification.</p>

<p>There are a set of MATLAB® functions to help explore the assimilation
performance in state-space as well as in observation-space. <a href="Research/Lorenz96/index.html">Exploring
the results of a Lorenz ‘96 OSSE</a>.</p>

<h1 id="perfect-model-experiment-overview">Perfect Model Experiment Overview</h1>

<p>There are four fundamental steps to running an OSSE from within DART:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#obs_blueprint">Create a blueprint</a> of what, where, and when you
want observations. Essentially, define the metadata of the
observations without actually specifying the observation values. The
default filename for the blueprint is <em>obs_seq.in</em>. For simple
cases, this is just running
<a href="https://ncar.github.io/DART/api/v2.1.10/program/create_obs_sequence.html">create_obs_sequence</a>
and
<a href="https://ncar.github.io/DART/api/v2.1.10/program/create_fixed_network_seq.html">create_fixed_network_seq</a>.
You can also use real observation sequences as long as you take care
to specify observation error variances that do not incorporate
representativeness error.</li>
  <li><a href="#run_pmo">Harvest the synthetic observations</a> from the true model
state by running
<a href="https://ncar.github.io/DART/api/v2.1.10/program/perfect_model_obs.html">perfect_model_obs</a>
to advance the model from a known initial condition and apply the
forward observation operator based on the observation ‘blueprint’.
The observation will have noise added to it based on a draw from a
random normal distribution with the variance specified in the
observation blueprint. The noise-free ‘truth’ and the noisy
‘observation’ are recorded in the output observation sequence file.
The entire time-history of the true state of the model is recorded
in <em>perfect_output.nc</em> . The default filename for the
‘observations’ is <em>obs_seq.out</em> .</li>
  <li><a href="#run_filter">Assimilate the synthetic observations</a> with
<a href="https://ncar.github.io/DART/api/v2.1.10/program/filter.html">filter</a> in
the usual way. The prior/forecast states are preserved in
<em>preassim.nc</em> and the posterior/analysis states are preserved in
<em>filter_output.nc</em> . The default filename for the file with the
observations and (optionally) the ensemble estimates of the
observations is <em>obs_seq.final</em> .</li>
  <li><a href="#run_diagnostics">Check to make sure the assimilation was
effective!</a> Ensemble DA is not a black box! YOU
must check to make sure you are making effective use of the
information in the observations!</li>
</ol>

<p><span id="obs_blueprint"></span></p>

<h2 id="1-defining-the-observation-metadata---the-blueprint">1. Defining the observation metadata - the ‘blueprint’.</h2>

<p>There are lots of ways to define an observation sequence that DART can
use as input for a perfect model experiment. If you have observations in
DART format already, you can simply use them. If you have observations
in one of the formats already supported by the DART converters (check
<a href="obs_converters_observations.html">DART/observations/obs_converters/observations.html</a>,
convert it to a DART observation sequence. You may need to use the
<a href="https://ncar.github.io/DART/api/v2.1.10/program/obs_sequence_tool.html">obs_sequence_tool</a>
to combine multiple observation sequence files into observation sequence
files for the perfect model experiment. Any existing observation values
and quality control information will be ignored by <em>perfect_model_obs</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>only the time and location information are used. In fact, any and all
existing observation and QC values will be removed.</li>
</ul>

<p>GENERAL COMMENT ABOUT THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE MODEL STOP/START
FREQUENCY AND THE IMPACT ON THE OBSERVATION FREQUENCY: There is usually
a very real difference between the dynamical timestep of the model and
when it is safe to stop and restart the model. The assimilation window
is (usually) required to be a multiple of the safe stop/start frequency.
For example, an atmospheric model may have a dynamical timestep of a few
seconds, but may be constrained such that it is only possible to
stop/restart every hour. In this case, the assimilation window is a
multiple of 3600 seconds. Trying to get observations at a finer
timescale is not possible, we only have access to the model state when
the model stops.</p>

<p>If you do not have an input observation sequence, it is simple to create
one.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Run
<a href="https://ncar.github.io/DART/api/v2.1.10/program/create_obs_sequence.html">create_obs_sequence</a>
to generate the blueprint for the types of observations and
observation error variances for whatever locations are desired.</li>
  <li>Run
<a href="https://ncar.github.io/DART/api/v2.1.10/program/create_fixed_network_seq.html">create_fixed_network_seq</a>
to define the temporal distribution of the desired observations.</li>
</ol>

<p>Both <em>create_obs_sequence</em> and <em>create_fixed_network_seq</em>
interactively prompt you for the information they require. This can be
quite tedious if you want a spatially dense set of observations. People
have been known to actually write programs to generate the input to
<em>create_obs_sequence</em> and simply pipe or redirect the information into
the program. There are several examples of these in the
<em>models/bgrid_solo</em> directory: <em>column_rand.f90,
id_set_def_stdin.f90, ps_id_stdin.f90,</em> and <em>ps_rand_local.f90</em> .
Be advised that some observation types have different input
requirements, so a ‘one size fits all’ program is a waste of time.</p>

<p>NOTE: only the observation kinds in the <em>input.nml</em> <strong>&amp;obs_kind_nml:assimilate_these_obs_types,evaluate_these_obs</strong> will be available to the <em>create_obs_sequence</em> program.</p>

<p>DEVELOPERS TIP: You can specify ‘identity’ observations as input to
<em>perfect_model_obs</em>. Identity observations are the model values AT the
exact gridcell location, there is no interpolation at all. Just a
straight table-lookup. This can be useful as you develop your model
interfaces; you can test many of the routines and scripts without having
a working <em>model_interpolate()</em>.</p>

<p>More information about creating observation sequence files for OSSE’s is
available in the <a href="DART2_Observations.html#obs_synthetic">Synthetic Observations
section</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://ncar.github.io/DART/api/v2.1.10/program/perfect_model_obs.html">perfect_model_obs</a>
reads the blueprint and an initial state and applies the appropriate
forward observation operator for each and every observation in the
current ‘assimilation window’. If necessary, the model is advanced until
the next set of observations is desired. When it has run out of
observations or reached the stop time defined by the namelist control,
the program stops and writes out restarts, diagnostics, observation
sequences, and a log file. This is fundamentally a single deterministic
forecast for ‘as long as it takes’ to harvest all the observations.</p>

<p>Each model may define the assimilation window differently, but
conceptually, all the observations plus or minus half the assimilation
window are considered to be simultaneous and a single model state
provides the basis for all those observations. For example: if the
blueprint requires temperature observations every 30 seconds, the
initial model time is noon (12:00) and the assimilation window is 1
hour; all the observations from 11:30 to 12:30 will use the same state
as input for the forward observation operator. The fact that you have a
blueprint for observations every 30 seconds means a lot of those
observations may have the same value (if they are in the same location).</p>

<p><em>perfect_model_obs</em> uses the <em>input.nml</em> for its control. A subset of
the namelists and variables of particular interest for
<em>perfect_model_obs</em> are summarized here. Each namelist is fully
described by the corresponding module document.</p>

<h2 id="executing-perfect_model_obs">Executing perfect_model_obs</h2>

<p>Since <em>perfect_model_obs</em> generally requires advancing the model, and
the model may use MPI or require special ancillary files or forcing
files or …, it is not possible to provide a single example that will
cover all possibilities. The subroutine-callable models (i.e. the
low-order models) can run <em>perfect_model_obs</em> very simply:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span id="run_filter"></span></p>

<h2 id="3-performing-the-assimilation-experiment---filter">3. Performing the assimilation experiment - <em>filter</em></h2>

<p>This step is done with the program
<a href="https://ncar.github.io/DART/api/v2.1.10/program/filter.html">filter</a>, which
also uses <em>input.nml</em> for input and run-time control. A successful
assimilation will depend on many things: an approprite initial ensemble,
monitoring and perhaps correcting the ensemble spread, localization,
etc. It is simply not possible to design a one-size-fits-all system that
will work for all cases. It is <strong>critically important</strong> to analyze the
results of the assimilation and explore ways of making the assimilation
more effective. The <a href="dart_tutorial.html">DART
tutorial</a> and the
<a href="dart_lab.html">DART_LAB</a> exercises
are an invaluable resource to learn and understand how to determine the
effectiveness of, and improve upon, an assimilation experiment. The
concepts learned with the low-order models are directly applicable to
the most complicated models.</p>

<p><strong>It is important to remember that if <em>filter</em> ‘terminates normally’, it
does not necessarily mean the assimilation was effective!</strong></p>

<p>The Manhattan release of DART allows for a very high degree of
customization when it comes to output. To stay focused on the concepts,
I will restrict the examples to models that have
<em>single_file_in = .true.</em>, <em>single_file_out = .true.</em>, and.
<em>stages_to_write = ’preassim’, ’output’</em>.</p>

<p><em>filter</em> generally produces at least two state-space output diagnostic
files (<em>preassim.nc</em> and <em>filter_output.nc</em>) which contains values of
the ensemble mean, ensemble spread, perhaps the inflation values, and
(optionally) ensemble members for the duration of the experiment.
<em>filter</em> also creates an observation sequence file that contains the
input observation information as well as the prior and posterior
ensemble mean estimates of that observation, the prior and posterior
ensemble spread for that observation, and (optionally), the actual prior
and posterior ensemble estimates of that observation. Rather than
replicate the observation metadata for each of these, the single
metadata is shared for all these ‘copies’ of the observation. See <a href="DART2_Observations.html#obs_seq_overview">An
overview of the observation
sequence</a> for more detail.
<em>filter</em> also produces a run-time log file that can greatly aid in
determining what went wrong if the program terminates abnormally.</p>

<p>A very short description of some of the most important namelist
variables is presented here. Basically, I am only discussing the
settings necessary to get <em>filter</em> to run. I can guarantee these
settings WILL NOT generate the BEST assimilation. Again, see the module
documentation for a full description of each namelist.</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="adding-a-model-to-dart---overview">Adding a model to DART - Overview</h1>

<p>DART is designed to work with many models <em>without</em> modifications to the
DART routines <strong>or</strong> the model source code. DART can ‘wrap around’ your
model in two ways. One can be used if your model can be called as a
subroutine, the other is for models that are separate executables.
Either way, there are some steps that are common to both paths.</p>

<p>Please be aware that several of the high-order models (CAM and WRF, in
particular) have been used for years and their scripts have incorporated
failsafe procedures and restart capabilities that have proven to be
useful but make the scripts complex - more complex than need be for the
initial attempts. Truly, some of the complexity is no longer required
for available platforms. Then again, we’re not running one instance of a
highly complicated computer model, we’re running N of them.</p>

<p><em>NEW</em> The DART Manhattan release provides native netCDF read/write
support. Consequently, there is no need for translation routines that we
have traditionally been calling <em>model_to_dart</em> or <em>dart_to_model</em>.
If, however, your model does not use netCDF for I/O, these programs must
be written. We have a lot of experience writing these converters - you
should not be afraid to ask for advice or for code to start from.</p>

<p><em>NEW</em> Manhattan provides a program to help test the required interfaces:
<a href="https://ncar.github.io/DART/api/v2.1.10/program/model_mod_check.html">assimilation_code/programs/model_mod_check/model_mod_check.f90</a>.
Many models start with this and modify it to suit their needs. Be aware
that some of the model-specific <em>model_mod_check.f90</em> programs use
deprecated features. Focus on the ones for Manhattan-compliant
models.</p>

<h2 id="the-basic-steps-to-include-your-model-in-dart---each-of-these-topics-has-its-own-section-farther-down">The basic steps to include your model in DART - each of these topics has its own section farther down.</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Copy the <em>models/template</em> directory and files to your own DART
model directory.</li>
  <li>Modify the <em>model_mod.f90</em> file to return specifics about your
model. This module MUST contain all the required interfaces (no
surprise) but it can also contain more interfaces as is convenient.
The required interfaces calling syntax (argument list) should not be
modified in any way.</li>
  <li><em>If your model cannot be called as a subroutine:</em> Modify
<em>shell_scripts/advance_model.csh</em> to collect all the input files
needed to advance the model into a clean, temporary directory,
convert the state vector file into input to your model, run your
model, and convert your model output to the expected format for
another assimilation by DART. DART will write out a control file
that contains some information that must be passed to
<em>advance_model.csh</em>: for example, the number of ensemble members,
the input and output filenames for each ensemble member, etc.
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare a directory (or multiple directories) with the contents
needed to advance your model.</li>
      <li>Modify the input to your model communicating the run-time
settings necessary to integrate your model from one time to
another <em>arbitrary</em> time in the future.</li>
      <li>Convert (if necessary) your input file to netCDF.</li>
      <li>Run the model (you may need to watch the MPI syntax)</li>
      <li>Convert (if necessary) the model output to a netCDF file DART
can use for the next assimilation.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><em>If a single instance of your model needs to advance using all the
MPI tasks</em>, there is one more script that needs to work -
<em>shell_scripts/run_filter.csh</em>. This script must do quite a lot.
Find some examples in the <em>models/*/shell_scripts</em> directories.</li>
  <li>[optional step] Modify the MATLAB® routines to know about the
specifics of the netCDF files produces by your model (sensible
defaults, for the most part.)</li>
  <li><em>Test</em>. Generally, it is a good strategy to use DART to create a
synthetic observation sequence with <em>ONE</em> observation location - and
<em>ONE</em> observation type - for several assimilation periods. With
that, it is possible to run <em>perfect_model_obs</em> and then <em>filter</em>
without having to debug too much stuff at once. A separate document
will address how to test your model with DART.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="programming-style">Programming style</h2>

<p>#1 Don’t shoot the messenger. We have a lot of experience trying to
write portable/reproducible code and offer these suggestions. All of
these suggestions are for the standalone DART components. We are not
asking you to rewrite your model. If your model is a separate
executable, leaving it untouched is fine. <strong>Writing portable code for
the DART components will allow us to include your model in the nightly
builds and reduces the risk of us making changes that adversely affect
the integration with your model.</strong> There are some routines that have to
play with the core DART routines, these are the ones we are asking you
to write using these few simple guidelines.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use explicit typing, do not use or rely on the ‘autopromote’ flag on
your compiler.</li>
  <li>Use the <em>intent()</em> attribute.</li>
  <li>Use the <em>use, xxx_mod, only : bob, sally</em> statements for routines
from other modules. This really helps us track down things and
ensures you’re using what you think you’re using.</li>
  <li>Use Fortran namelists for I/O if possible.</li>
  <li>Check out the existing parameters/routines in
<em>assimilation_code/modules/utilities/types_mod.f90</em>,
<em>assimilation_code/modules/utilities/utilities_mod.f90</em>, and
<em>assimilation_code/modules/utilities/time_manager_mod.f90</em>. You
are free to use these and are encouraged to do so. No point
reinventing the wheel and these routines have been tested
extensively.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hopefully, you have no idea how difficult it is to build each model with
‘unique’ compile options on N different platforms. Fortran90 provides a
nice mechanism to specify the type of variable, please do not use
vendor-specific extensions. (To globally autopromote 32bit reals to
64bit reals, for example. That is a horrible thing to do, since vendors
are not consistent about what happens to explicitly-typed variables.
Trust me. They lie. It also defeats the generic procedure interfaces
that are designed to use a single interface as a front-end to multiple
‘type-specific’ routines.) Compilers do abide by the standard, however,
so DART code looks like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>   character(len=8)      :: crdate
   integer, dimension(8) :: values
   ...
   real(r4) :: a,b
   real(r8) :: bob
   integer  :: istatus, itype
   ...
   real(r8),            intent(in)  :: x(:)
   type(location_type), intent(in)  :: location
   integer,             intent(in)  :: itype
   integer,             intent(out) :: istatus
   real(r8),            intent(out) :: obs_val  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>depending on the use. The <em>r4</em> and <em>r8</em> types are explicitly defined in
<em>assimilation_code/modules/utilities/types_mod.f90</em> to accurately
represent what we have come to expect from 32bit and 64bit floating
point real variables, respectively. If you like, you can redefine <em>r8</em>
to be the same as <em>r4</em> to shrink your memory requirement. The people who
run with WRF frequently do this. Do not redefine the <em>digits12</em>
parameter, that one must provide 64bit precision, and is used in
precious few places.</p>

<hr />

<p><span id="addingAmodelSpecific"></span></p>

<h1 id="adding-a-model-to-dart---specifics">Adding a model to DART - Specifics</h1>

<p>If your model is a separate executable, it would be wise to look at the
heavily commented template script
<a href="https://github.com/ncar/dart/models/template/shell_scripts/advance_model.csh">models/template/shell_scripts/advance_model.csh</a>
and then a few higher-order models to see how they do it. Become
familiar with <a href="dart_mpi.html">DART’s use of
MPI</a>, the <a href="filter_async_modes.html">options for
parallelism</a>, and
the <em>filter</em> namelist parameter
<a href="https://ncar.github.io/DART/api/v2.1.10/program/filter.html"><em>async</em></a>.</p>

<p><span id="Copying"></span></p>

<h2 id="1-copying-the-template-directory">1. Copying the template directory</h2>

<p>A little explanation/motivation is warranted. If the model uses the
standard layout, it is much easier to include the model in the nightly
builds and testing. For this reason alone, please try to use the
recommended directory layout. Simply looking at the <em>DART/models</em>
directory should give you a pretty good idea of how things should be
laid out. Copy the <em>template</em> directory and its contents. It is best to
remove the (hidden) subversion files to keep the directory ‘clean’. The
point of copying this directory is to get a <em>model_mod.f90</em> that works
as-is and you can modify/debug the routines one at a time.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>~/DART/models % cp -r template mymodel
    ~/DART/models % find mymodel -name .svn -print
    mymodel/.svn
    mymodel/shell_scripts/.svn
    mymodel/work/.svn
    ~/DART/models % rm -rf `find mymodel -name .svn -print`
    ~/DART/models % find mymodel -name .svn -print
    ~/DART/models %
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The destination directory (your model directory) should be in the
<em>DART/models</em> directory to keep life simple. Moving them around will
cause problems for the <em>work/mkmf_</em>xxxxx** configuration files. Each
model directory should have a <em>work</em> and <em>shell_scripts</em> directories,
and may have a <em>matlab</em> directory, a <em>src</em> directory, or anything else
you may find convenient.</p>

<p>Now, you must change all the <em>work/path_names_</em>xxx** file contents to
reflect the location of your <em>model_mod.f90</em>.</p>

<p><span id="model_mod"></span></p>

<h2 id="2-model_modf90">2. model_mod.f90</h2>

<p>We have templates, examples, and a document describing the required
interfaces in the DART code tree -
<a href="Manhattan/models/template/model_mod.html">DART/models/template/model_mod.html</a>.
Every(?) user-visible DART program/module is intended to have a matching
piece of documentation that is distributed along with the code. The DART
code tree always has the most current documentation.</p>

<p>Check out <em>time_manager_mod.f90</em> and <em>utilities_mod.f90</em> for
general-purpose routines …</p>

<p>Use Fortran namelists for I/O if possible.</p>

<p>Modify the <em>model_mod.f90</em> file to return specifics about your model.
This module MUST contain all the required interfaces (no surprise) but
it can also contain many more interfaces as is convenient. This module
should be written with the understanding that print statements and error
terminations will be executed by multiple processors/tasks. To restrict
print statements to be written once (by the master task), it is
necessary to preface the print as in this example:</p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>if (do_output()) write(*,*)'model_mod:namelist cal_NML',startDate_1,startDate_2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><span id="requiredinterfaces"></span></p>

<h3 id="required-interfaces-in-model_modf90">Required Interfaces in model_mod.f90</h3>

<p>No matter the complexity of the model, the DART software requires a few
interface routines in a model-specific Fortran90 module <em>model_mod.f90</em>
file. The <em>models/template/model_mod.f90</em> file has extended comment
blocks at the heads of each of these routines that go into much more
detail for what is to be provided. <strong>You cannot change the types or
number of required arguments to any of the required interface
routines.</strong> You can add optional arguments, but you cannot go back
throught the DART tree to change the gazillion calls to the mandatory
routines. It is absolutely appropriate to look at existing models to get
ideas about how to implement the interfaces. Finding a model
implementation that is functionally close to yours always helps.</p>

<h1 id="cycling-models">Cycling Models</h1>

<h2 id="overview-2">Overview</h2>

<p>For simple models which can be advanced by a subroutine call, the
<em>filter</em> program is driven by the input observation sequence. It
assimilates all observations in the current assimilation window and then
advances the model state until the window includes the next available
observation. When it runs out of observations, <em>filter</em> exits.</p>

<p>For complex models which are themselves an MPI program or have
complicated scripting to run the model here are some simplified
considerations for scripting an experiment. A “cycling script” would
need to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>[if needed] Run the ensemble of models forward to the time of the
first observation.</li>
  <li>The input observation sequence file should be created (or trimmed)
to only include observations in the current window.</li>
  <li>Run <em>filter</em> to assimilate all observations in the current window.</li>
  <li>Save a copy of the output files and diagnostic files. Often a
timestamp is used as part of the filename or subdirectory name to
make it unique.</li>
  <li>Run the ensemble of models forward in time.</li>
  <li>Run <em>filter</em> again.</li>
  <li>Repeat until all observations have been assimilated.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="in-more-detail">In More Detail</h2>

<p>The <em>filter</em> program requires an ensemble of model output files in
NetCDF file format as input. If the model does not use NetCDF a
translation step from the model native format to NetCDF is needed. The
files are often named with the ensemble number as part of the name and
also with a timestamp as part of the filename or part of a subdirectory
name which contains all the files for that timestep. Symbolic links can
be used to link a common simpler name to a file with a timestamp in the
filename or directory name.</p>

<p>The <em>filter</em> program also requires an input observation sequence file.
Often these are named with a timestamp to indicate the central time of
the observations, e.g. <em>obs_seq.2010-10-04.00:00:00</em> and then a common
name (e.g. <em>obs_seq.out</em>) is used with a symbolic link to indicate the
right file for input.</p>

<p>If adaptive inflation is being used the <em>filter</em> program also requires
inflation input files. Again, timestamps in the names with a common
symbolic link name are often used here.</p>

<p>The <em>filter</em> program runs.</p>

<p>The output of the <em>filter</em> program include updated model files using one
of three different workflows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The <em>filter</em> program directly overwrites the input files.
    <ul>
      <li>Advantages: uses the least amount of disk usage and minimizes
file copying.</li>
      <li>Disadvantages: if something crashes the files can be left in an
indeterminate state making restarting more complicated.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The script copies the input files to the output names, and the
<em>filter</em> program updates the existing files.
    <ul>
      <li>Advantages: The <em>filter</em> program can easily be restarted in case
of problems because the original input files are unchanged. The
output files are immediately available to be used as input to
the model.</li>
      <li>Disadvantages: uses more disk space.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The <em>filter</em> program creates new output files from scratch.
    <ul>
      <li>Advantages: The output files are smaller since they only contain
the state vector and no other grid or auxiliary information. The
<em>filter</em> program can easily be restarted in case of problems.</li>
      <li>Disadvantages: generally requires a post-processing step to
insert the updated state information into full model restart
files.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The script should also save the <em>obs_seq.final</em> diagnostic file,
possibly with a timestamp in the filename or subdirectory name, and the
updated inflation files in the case where adaptive inflation is used.</p>

<p>The script can run the ensemble of models forward in time in many ways.
A few of the ways we’re aware of are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>If a queuing system is available, the ensemble of models can be
submitted either as independent jobs or using the batch system’s job
array syntax. They run as soon as resources are available. The
disadvantage is it can be complicated to know when all the jobs have
finished successfully.</li>
  <li>On smaller clusters the ensemble members can be advanced one after
the other in a loop. There is no question about when the last member
has been advanced and it requires no more resources than running a
single copy of the model. The disadvantage is this is the slowest
wall-clock way to advance the ensemble.</li>
</ol>

<p><span id="scriptingbackground"></span> <span id="advance_model"></span></p>

<h2 id="3-advance_modelcsh">3. advance_model.csh</h2>

<h2 id="the-big-picture-for-models-advanced-as-separate-executables">The Big Picture for models advanced as separate executables.</h2>

<p>The normal sequence of events is that DART reads in its own restart file
(do not worry about where this comes from right now) and eventually
determines it needs to advance the model. DART needs to be able to take
its internal representation of each model state vector, the valid time
of that state, and the amount of time to advance the state - and
communicate that to the model. When the model has advanced the state to
the requested time, the output must be ingested by DART and the cycle
begins again. DART is entirely responsible for reading the observations
and there are several programs for creating and manipulating the
observation sequence files.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways to exploit parallel architectures with DART,
and these have an immediate bearing on the design of the script(s) that
control how the model instances (each model <em>copy</em>) are advanced.
Perhaps the conceptually simplest method is when each model instance is
advanced by a single processor element. DART calls this <em>async = 2</em>. It
is generally efficient to relate the ensemble size to the number of
processors being used.</p>

<p>The alternative is to advance every model instance one after another
using all available processors for each instance of the model. DART
calls this <em>async = 4</em>, and requires an additional script. For
portability reasons, DART uses the same processor set for both the
assimilation and the model advances. For example, if you advance the
model with 96 processors, all 96 processors will be employed to
assimilate. If your model requires 2000 processors, all 2000 will be
employed for the assimilation. Some people exploit the queueing systems
on their large machines to allow for the explicit customization of how
many tasks are used for each model advance and for an assimilation.</p>

<p><em>advance_model.csh</em> is invoked in one of two ways: 1) if <em>async = 2</em>
then <em>filter</em> uses a <em>system()</em> call, or 2) if <em>async = 4</em> then
<em>run_filter.csh</em> makes the call. Either way there are three arguments.</p>

<ol>
  <li>the process number of the caller - could be the master task ID
(zero) or (especially if <em>async = 2</em>) a process id that gets related
to the copy. When multiple copies are being advanced simultaneously,
each of the advances happens in its own run-time directory.</li>
  <li>the number of state copies belonging to that process</li>
  <li>
    <p>the name of the (ASCII) filter_control_file for that process. The
filter_control file contains the following information (one per
line): the ensemble member, the name of the input file (containing
the DART state vector), and the name of the output file from the
model containing the new DART state vector. For example,</p>

    <div class="routine">
1  
assim_model_state_ic.0001  
assim_model_state_ud.0001  
2  
assim_model_state_ic.0002  
assim_model_state_ud.0002  
...
</div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="async--2--advancing-many-copies-at-the-same-time">async = 2 … advancing many copies at the same time</h3>

<p>Modify <em>shell_scripts/advance_model.csh</em> to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Collect all the input files needed to advance the model into a
clean, temporary directory.</li>
  <li>Create a routine or set of routines to modify the input to your
model communicating the run-time settings necessary to integrate
your model from one time to another <em>arbitrary</em> time in the future.
These routines are called in the <em>advance_model.csh</em> script. Every
model is controlled differently, so writing detailed descriptions
here is pointless.</li>
  <li>Determine how many tasks you have, and how many ensemble members you
have. Determine how many ‘batches’ of ensemble members must be done
to advance all of them. With 20 tasks and 80 ensemble members, you
will need to loop 4 times, for example. clean, temporary directory,
and</li>
  <li>Loop over the following steps - each loop advances one ensemble
member:
    <ol>
      <li>If necessary, convert the DART (posterior) file into input for
your model, After DART has assimilated the observations and
created new (posterior) states, it may be necessary to
post-process these states to impose model-specific limitations.
There is nothing in the ensemble filter methodology that
restricts posteriors to be physically meaningful (soil moistures
could be slightly negative, for example), or that related
quantities in the state have been conserved. Since each model
handles these situations differently, it is up to the user to
write any post-processing routines that may be necessary to
check for viable input to the model. Frequently this is done by
a program called <em>dart_to_model.f90</em>. If you need to do this,
you will also need to create/modify a <em>mkmf_dart_to_model</em>
and <em>path_names_dart_to_model</em> specific to your model.</li>
      <li>run your model, and</li>
      <li>if necessary, convert your model output (the prior) to netCDF or
simply rename or link to the appropriate filename for another
assimilation by DART.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<p>During this initial phase, it may be useful to <em>leave</em> the temporary
directory intact until you verify everything is as it should be.</p>

<p>In addition to modifying <em>shell_scripts/advance_model.csh</em> as
described above, you must also modify <em>shell_scripts/run_filter.csh</em>

<p>Generally testing when you add a new model to DART includes:<br />
Checking the converter programs.<br />
Checking the model advance control.<br />
Starting with one observation in a known location, with a known value
and error specification.<br />
Performing a ‘perfect model’ experiment for a few timesteps.<br />

<h2 id="assimilation-algorithms-employed-in-dart">Assimilation Algorithms employed in DART.</h2>

<p>The DART system includes several different types of Kalman filter
algorithms, selectable at runtime by a namelist setting. See the
documentation for the <a href="https://ncar.github.io/DART/api/v2.1.10/module/assim_tools_mod.html">assimilation tools
module</a>
for descriptions of the various filter types and how to select them.</p>

<p><span id="namelists" class="anchor"></span></p>

<p>[<a href="#">top</a>]</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="namelists">Namelists</h2>

<p>Many DART programs have namelists to specify run-time control. Some
programs use one or more modules - each module may have its own
namelist. As a consequence, we find it convenient to have one file
(called <em>input.nml</em>) specifying all the namelists.</p>

<p>For a complete list of namelists, see the following document: <a href="Manhattan/documentation/index.html#Namelists">master
list of namelists</a></p>

<p>An example namelist for each program is automatically built when the
makefile is generated by <em>mkmf_xxxxx</em>. The example namelist is named
<em>input.nml.xxxxx_default</em> where <em>xxxxx</em> is the name of the program. The
example namelists have default values, which may not be appropriate for
your use. The default <em>input.nml</em> in each <em>work</em> directory generally has
better values. As usual, the documentation for each module is the best
place to get information about the namelist settings.</p>
