<h1 id="an-overview-of-the-dart-preprocess-program">An overview of the DART ‘preprocess’ program</h1>

<p>First and foremost, check out
<a href="https://ncar.github.io/DART/api/v2.1.10/program/preprocess.html">preprocess.html</a>
for detailed information.</p>

<p>The <em>preprocess</em> program actually builds source code to be used by all
the remaining modules. It is <strong>imperative</strong> to actually <strong>run</strong>
<em>preprocess</em> before building any executables. This is how the same code
can assimilate synthetic ‘observations’ for the Lorenz_63 model and
real radar reflectivities for WRF without needing to specify a set of
radar operators for the Lorenz_63 model!</p>

<p><em>preprocess</em> combines multiple ‘obs_def’ modules into one
<em>obs_def_mod.f90</em> that is then used by the rest of DART. Additionally,
a new <em>obs_kind_mod.f90</em> is built that will provide support for
associating the specific observation <strong>TYPES</strong> with corresponding
(generic) observation <strong>QUANTITIES</strong>. More on that later. The list of
source codes is contained in the <em>&amp;preprocess_nml</em> namelist and they
ultimately determine what observations and operators are supported. If
you want to add another ‘obs_def’ module, you <strong>must</strong> rerun
<em>preprocess</em> and recompile the rest of your project. <em>preprocess</em> is
designed to abort if the files it is supposed to build already exist.
For this reason, it is necessary to remove a couple files (if they
exist) before you run the preprocessor. It is just a good habit to
develop.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>\rm -f ../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_def_mod.f90
\rm -f ../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_kind_mod.f90
./preprocess
ls -l ../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_def_mod.f90
ls -l ../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_kind_mod.f90
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For example, with a namelist that looks like:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&amp;preprocess_nml
    input_obs_kind_mod_file = '../../../assimilation_code/modules/observations/DEFAULT_obs_kind_mod.F90' 
    output_obs_kind_mod_file = '../../../assimilation_code/modules/observations/obs_kind_mod.f90' 
    input_obs_def_mod_file = '../../../observations/forward_operators/DEFAULT_obs_def_mod.F90' 
    input_files              = '../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_def_gps_mod.f90',
                              '../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_def_QuikSCAT_mod.f90',
                              '../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_def_GWD_mod.f90',
                              '../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_def_altimeter_mod.f90',
                              '../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_def_reanalysis_bufr_mod.f90' 
    output_obs_def_mod_file = '../../../observations/forward_operators/obs_def_mod.f90'
    /
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>preprocess</em> will combine <em>DEFAULT_obs_def_mod.F90</em>,
<em>obs_def_gps_mod.f90</em>, <em>obs_def_QuikSCAT_mod.f90</em>,
<em>obs_def_GWD_mod.f90</em>, <em>obs_def_altimeter_mod.f90</em>, and
<em>obs_def_reanalysis_bufr_mod.f90</em>, into <em>obs_def_mod.f90</em> - which
can be used by the rest of the project.</p>

<h2 id="building-and-running-preprocess">Building and Running ‘preprocess’</h2>

<p><em>preprocess</em> is an executable, so it should come as no surprise that it
must be built in the normal DART fashion. The
<em>DART/build_templates/mkmf.template</em> must be correct for your
environment, and the <em>input.nml</em> must have your desired preprocess_nml
set correctly. Given that …</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>csh mkmf_preprocess  
make  
./preprocess
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>will build and run <em>preprocess</em>.</p>

<p>The first command generates an appropriate <em>Makefile</em> and the
<em>input.nml.preprocess_default</em> file. The second command results in the
compilation of a series of Fortran90 modules which ultimately produces
an executable file: <em>preprocess</em>. The third command actually runs
preprocess - which builds the new <em>obs_kind_mod.f90</em> and
<em>obs_def_mod.f90</em> source code files. The rest of DART may now be
built.</p>

<h2 id="the-rationale-for-preprocess">The rationale for ‘preprocess’</h2>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Since each ‘observation quantity’ may require different
amounts of metadata to be read or written; any routine to read or write
an observation sequence <strong>must</strong> be compiled with support for those
particular observations. The supported observations are listed in the
<em>input.nml&amp;obs_kind_nml</em> block. This is the <strong>whole point</strong> of the
‘preprocess’ process …</p>

<p>For example, radar observations need extra metadata to specify the
location of the radar in addition to the location of the observation,
radiosondes only require the observation location. GPS occultations need
the locations of the two satellites so the forward operator can
integrate along the raypath, cosmic ray soil moisture sensors (yes, they
exist) have forward operators that require site-specific calibration
parameters that are not part of the model and must be included in the
observation metadata. That sort of thing.</p>

<p><span id="obs_seq_overview" class="anchor"></span></p>

<p>[<a href="#">top</a>]</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="an-overview-of-the-observation-sequence">An overview of the observation sequence</h1>

<p>Observation sequences are complicated, there’s just no better way to
describe it. Trying to automatically accomodate a myriad of observation
file formats, structure, and metadata is simply not an easy task. For
this reason, DART has its own format for observations and a set of
programs to convert observations from their original formats to DART’s
format. There are definitely some things to know …</p>

<p>An <strong><em>obs_seq.in</em></strong> file actually contains no observation quantities.
It may be best thought of as a <strong>perfectly</strong>-laid-out notebook - just
waiting for an observer to fill in the actual observation quantities.
All the rows and columns are ready, labelled, and repeated for every
observation time and platform. This file is generally the start of a
“perfect model” experiment. Essentially, one instance of the model is
run through <em>perfect_model_obs</em> - which applies the appropriate
forward operators to the model state and ‘writes them down’ in our
notebook. The completed notebook is renamed <em>obs_seq.out</em>.</p>

<p>An <strong><em>obs_seq.out</em></strong> file contains a linked list of observations -
potentially (and usually) observations from different platforms and of
different quantities - each with their own error characteristics and
metadata. These files arise from running <em>perfect_model_obs</em> <strong>OR</strong>
from any number of converter programs. The creation of observation
sequences from real observations is not automatic and an email to the
DART team asking for advice for your specific types of observations is
perfectly within reason.</p>

<p>There is something called an <strong><em>obs_seq.final</em></strong> file - which contains
everything in the <em>obs_seq.out</em> file as well as a few additional
‘copies’ of the observation. Remember, DART is an ensemble algorithm.
Each ensemble member must compute its own estimate of the observation
for the algorithm. The <em>obs_seq.final</em> file <em>may</em> contain each of these
estimates (namelist controlled). Minimally, the mean and spread of the
ensemble estimates is recorded in the <em>obs_seq.final</em> file. The best
method of determining the performance of your ‘real world’ experiment is
to compare in <em>observation-space</em> since we can never know the model
state that perfectly represents the real world.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Since each ‘observation kind’ may require different
amounts of metadata to be read or written; any routine to read or write
an observation sequence <strong>must</strong> be compiled with support for those
particular observations. The supported observations are listed in the
<em>input.nml&amp;obs_kind_nml</em> block. This is the <strong>whole point</strong> of the
‘preprocess’ process

<h1 id="creating-observations-and-sequences">Creating observations and sequences.</h1>

<p><strong>It is strongly encouraged that you use a single observation to test a
new model implementation.</strong></p>

<p>Experience has shown that starting ‘simple’ is the fastest way to good
results. Starting with a <strong>single</strong> observation will exercise a
sufficient portion of the procedure and provide insight into where to
spend more effort. Starting with a single <em>synthetic</em> observation will
allow you to focus on the more interesting parts of the DART scheme
without getting bogged down in the world of observation data formats.</p>

<p><span id="obs_seq_osse"></span></p>

<h1 id="creating-a-synthetic-observation-sequence">Creating a synthetic observation sequence.</h1>

<p>There are several steps to create an observation sequence file, which
follows directly from the modular nature of the DART programming
philosophy.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Decide what observations you want to investigate and edit the
<em>input.nml&amp;obs_kind_nml</em> block.</li>
  <li>Build and run <em>preprocess</em> to create code that supports the
observations you want.</li>
  <li>Build and run <em>create_obs_sequence</em> to define the specifics about
the observation you want.</li>
  <li>Build and run <em>create_fixed_network_sequence</em> to replicate those
specifics through time.</li>
  <li>Build and run <em>perfect_model_obs</em> to create an observation
consistent with the model state and specified error distribution at
the requested times and locations.</li>

<p>2) Run <em>preprocess</em> in the normal fashion.</p>

<p>3) <em>create_obs_sequence</em> creates an <em>observation set definition</em>
(typically named <em>set_def.out</em>), the time-independent part of an
observation sequence. It may help to think of it as trying to define
what sorts of observations will be taken at one ‘reading’ … you walk
out to the box and take temperature, humidity, and wind observations all
at the same time and place, for example. You can think of it as one page
in an observer’s notebook, and only contains the <em>location, type,</em> and
<em>observational error characteristics</em> (normally just the diagonal
observational error variance) for a related set of observations. There
are no actual observation values, nor are there any times associated
with the definition. The program is interactive and queries the user for
the information it needs. Begin by creating a minimal observation set
definition in which each of the 3 state variables of L63 is directly
observed with an observational error variance of 1.0 for each
observation. To do this, use the following input sequence (the text
including and after # is a comment and does not need to be entered):</p>

<p>The following is a screenshot (much of the verbose logging has been left
off for clarity), the user input looks <em>like this</em>.</p>

<p>Rest assured that if you requested to assimilate more realistic
observation types, you will be queried for appropriate information by
<em>create_obs_sequence</em>. Below is a table that explains all of the input
you should need to supply for observations of the L63 model state.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>4            # upper bound on num of observations in sequence
0            # number of copies of data (0 for just a definition)
0            # number of quality control values per field (0 or greater)
0            # -1 to exit/end observation definitions

-1           # observe state variable 1
0   0        # time -- days, seconds
1.0          # observational variance
0            # -1 to exit/end observation definitions

-2           # observe state variable 2
0   0        # time -- days, seconds
1.0          # observational variance
0            # -1 to exit/end observation definitions

-3           # observe state variable 3
0   0        # time -- days, seconds
1.0          # observational variance
-1           # -1 to exit/end observation definitions

set_def.out  # Output file name
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>4) <em>create_fixed_network_sequence</em> takes the observation set
definition and repeats it in time, essentially making multiple pages in
our notebook. Again, the program is interactive and queries the user for
information. You should be able to simply follow the prompts. The table
below represents the input needed for the L63
example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>set_def.out # Input observation set definition file          
1           # Regular spaced observation interval in time      
1000        # 1000 observation times                           0, 43200    # First observation after 12 hours (0 days, 12 \* 3600 seconds)
0, 43200    # Observations every 12 hours                      obs_seq.in  # Output file for observation sequence definition
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>5) <em>perfect_model_obs</em> advances the model from the state defined by
the initial conditions file specified in the <em>input.nml</em> and ‘applies
the forward operator’ to harvest observations to fill in the observation
sequence specified in <em>obs_seq.in</em>. The observation sequence finally
has values for the observations and is saved in a file generally named
<em>obs_seq.out</em>. <em>perfect_model_obs</em> is namelist-driven, as opposed to
the previous two (whose input is a lot harder to specify in a namelist).
Take a look at (and modify if you like) the
<em>input.nml&amp;perfect_model_obs_nml</em> section of the namelist.</p>

<p>The End. Not only should you have an observation sequence file (usually
<em>obs_seq.out</em>) , you also have a file containing the exact evolution of
the model consistent with those observations - the true state:
<em>perfect_output.nc</em>.</p>

<h1 id="real-observations---converting-to-a-dart-compatible-format">Real Observations - Converting to a DART-compatible format.</h1>

<p>Real observations come in a mind-boggling diversity of formats. We have
converters for many formats in the <em>DART/observations/obs_converters</em>
directory. The documentation for that directory is listed in
<a href="Manhattan/observations/obs_converters/observations.html">observations.html</a>.</p>

<p>The converters are designed to work on one input file format and create
(or add to) an output observation sequence. It may be desirable to
post-process multiple observation sequence files with the
<a href="https://ncar.github.io/DART/api/v2.1.10/program/obs_sequence_tool.html">obs_sequence_tool</a>
… to select for timeframe, geographic region, etc.</p>

<p>Many of the formats require their own libraries (like HDF), and require
intimate knowledge of the data format to extract the portions required
for the <a href="DART2_Observations.html#obs_seq_overview">DART observation sequence
file</a>. Please feel free to
browse the converters and their companion documentation. Feel free to
donate converters for formats we don’t already support! We like that
kind of stuff.</p>

<p>The DART framework enforces a clean separation between observations and
the models used for assimilation. The same observations can be used in
any model which understands how to generate a value for the requested
type of observation from the models’ state-space values (i.e. the
forward observation operator must exist - DART provides many for the
most common state variables).</p>

<p>In many cases, the original datasets are in a standard scientific format
like netCDF, HDF, or BUFR, and library routines for those formats can be
used to read in the original observation data. The DART software
distribution includes Fortran subroutines and functions to help create a
sequence of observations in memory, and then a call to the DART
observation sequence write routine will create an entire <em>obs_seq</em> file
in the correct format.</p>

<p>In many cases, a single, self-contained program can convert directly
from the observation location, time, value, and error into the DART
format. In other cases, especially those linking with a complicated
external library (e.g. BUFR), there is a two-step process with two
programs and an ASCII intermediate file. We are currently leaning
towards single-step conversions but either approach can be used for new
programs.</p>

<p>The DART system comes with several types of location modules for
computing distances appropriately. The two most commonly used are for
data in a 1D system and for data in a 3D spherical coordinate system.
All the programs in the <em>DART/observations</em> directory assume the
<em>location/threed_sphere/location_mod.f90</em> 3D sphere location module is
being used.</p>

<p>With the myriad of observation file formats, HDF, Grib, BUFR, netCDF,
… we simply have not had the time nor need to support all of them. The
converters are a work in progress. There are currently about 10 other
observation sources and types which we are in the process of collecting
information and conversion programs for and which will eventually be
added to this directory. In the meantime, if you have converters for
data or interest in something that is not in the repository, please
email the DART group. Your best bet is to contact our group at
<em>dart@ucar.edu</em> with a specific request and we can steer you to the most
similar process.</p>

<h1 id="manipulating-observation-sequences">Manipulating observation sequences.</h1>

<p>First and foremost, check out the
<a href="https://ncar.github.io/DART/api/v2.1.10/program/obs_sequence_tool.html">obs_sequence_tool.html</a>
document for detailed information and examples.</p>

<p><em>obs_sequence_tool</em> is the primary tool for manipulating observation
sequence files. Observations sequence files are linked lists of
observations organized by time. That is to say, the observations may
appear in any order in the file, but traversing the linked list will
result in observations ordered by time. <em>obs_sequence_tool</em> can be
used to combine observation sequences, convert from ASCII to binary or
vice-versa, extract a subset of observations, etc.</p>

<p>For testing, it is terribly useful to extract a small number of
observations (like ONE) from an existing observation sequence file.</p>

<p><span id="adding_types" class="anchor"></span></p>

<p>[<a href="#">top</a>]</p>

<hr />

<h1 id="the-difference-between-observation-type-and-observation-quantity">The difference between observation TYPE and observation QUANTITY.</h1>

<p>Broadly speaking, observation TYPES are specific instances of a generic
observation QUANTITY. The distinction is useful for several reasons, not
the least of which is to evaluate observation platforms. Zonal wind
observations from QuikSCAT vs. radiosondes, for example. They are both
observations of zonal winds (what we call QTY_U_WIND_COMPONENT), but
they are different observation TYPES; QKSWND_U_WIND_COMPONENT, and
RADIOSONDE_U_WIND_COMPONENT, respectively. The forward observation
operators are implemented based on observation QUANTITY. When requested,
the model generates a QTY_U_WIND_COMPONENT, it doesn’t need to know
that it will be compared to a QuikSCAT value or a radiosonde value.</p>

<p><strong>However</strong>, it is usually scientifically very interesting to be able to
compare the assimilations one TYPE of observation vs. another. One
observation sequence file can have lots of types of observations; DART
has the capability to assimilate (or evaluate) any combination of
observation types without getting bogged down in dataset management. The
same observation sequence can be used for experiments that
include/exclude certain observation types - ensuring that you are
performing the experiment you THINK you are performing
…</p>
