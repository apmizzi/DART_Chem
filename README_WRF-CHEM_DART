WRF-Chem/DART build sequence:

1.    Add a global environment variable 'DART' to  your environment shell script that is set to the path for DART_Chem

2.    Modify ../DART_Chem/build_templates/mkmf.template' for your computing system as described in the DART documentation.

3.    Go to '../DART_Chem/models/wrf_chem/work' and run './quickbuild.sh.' This builds the DART code for use with WRF-Chem.

4.    Go to '../DART_Chem/observations/obs_converers/ATMOS_CHEM' and run ./quickbuild.xxx where xxs is the applicable shell extension for each observation platform that you might want to assimilate. Note: there is no 'build_all.xxx' script in this directory and legacy 'build_all.xxx' scripts may not build all the observation converters that you want to use. It is best to go to the appropriate observation converter 'work' directory and build the converter.  

5.    Go to '../DART_Chem/apm_run_scripts' and review the README file. As mentioned in the README, you need to go to the 'work' directory for each utitlity and run './quickbuild.sh'.
