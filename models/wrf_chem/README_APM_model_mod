Some observation types, like satellite total/partial and/or profile retrieval observations, depend on the vertical profile of various model state variables like T, q, P, no2, etc. The observation forward operators use the model_mod interpolator to interpolate the model state variables to the observation location or the observation forward operator grid. 

This interpolation code begins near line 1426. The xyz_loc (x, y, z location is based on the observation). The vertical cordinate stuff (line 1493 to 1686) is based on the observation vertical cordinate. The variable 'v_p' contains the model vertical pressure cordinate grid which is dependent on ensemble member .

The procedure 'pres_to_zk_distrib' return the variable 'zloc' which is the model level corresponding to the observation or forward operator vertical coordinate for each ensemble member. In lines 1509 to 1641, the model_mod is checking for vertical coordinte type provided by the interpolation calling statement. The 'pressure' vertical coordiante code is at lines 1513 to 1553.

Line 1643 to 1687 check whether any of the 'zloc' values are missing values. 'wrf%dom(id)%bt' is the vertical grid array dimension. 

The horizontal interpolation code is at line 1687 to 4468.
